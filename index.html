        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p> Hello There! My name is Connor Ward. I'm currently in the Information Technology and Cybersecurity Degree at Neumont College Of Computer Science.
            I am very passionate about video games, Dungeons and Dragons and movies. Building this website was actually a lot more fun than I expected it to be.</p>
        <p> I consider myself to be an incredibly caring and curious person. I love hearing people's opinions on many, MANY things and discussing those topics with them.
            I hope that this website going forward can help bring that to light.
        </p> IF you would like to contact me, here is my following information: 
              Email: cward@.student.neumont.edu
